# Selenium WebDriver and TestNG application for Teammates
This repository contains some new features of webdriver and Testng 
that I learned recently while preparing for GSOC 2017. I belief at this particular 
point in time all test for web applications should be automated using renown and profesional tools 
like Selenium WebDriver (selenium 2.0) and Testng.
Selenium Webdriver and is merge[in 2008] of Selenium core[A project initiated by Jason Huggins in 2004 where 
He develop a javascript library that could drive interactions 
with the pages, allowing him to automatically runn tests against multiple browsers.] and WebDriver [ A project started in 2006
by simon Stewart a google plugy. Simon wanted a testing tool that could spoke directly to the browser using the native 
methods for browser and operating systems, thus avoiding the restrictions of sandboxed javascriopt environment]. 
There is high advantage for building you automation test using these tools as they both follow an OOP paradiagm,
does not depend on any intermediary to interact with your browser since they use native languages to interact directly
with wed browsers. Web driver provides binding for quite a number of programming langauges like JAVA, PHP , C#, Python and Ruby
Webdriver has rich built in feature for handling multiple frames, multiple browser windows , popups and alerts.
Webdriver provides advance UI navigation such as drag and drops 
In addition to all these Webdriver ensures complex page navigation and has rich build in Ajax-base UI elements
               There is very much to learn on Selenium WebDriver and Testng
